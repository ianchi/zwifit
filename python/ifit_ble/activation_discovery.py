BLE Activation Code Discovery

This module implements a BLE peripheral simulator that intercepts
the activation code from the manufacturer's app, similar to the
JavaScript enable.js implementation.

The process works by:
1. Creating a BLE peripheral that mimics the treadmill
2. Connecting to the real treadmill as a central
3. Proxying commands between the manufacturer's app and the treadmill
4. Capturing the activation code from the Enable command
